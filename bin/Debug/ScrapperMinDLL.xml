                I am thinking this may be useful in a Stream that uses this
                compressor class. In the Close() method on the stream it could
                check this value to see if anything has been written at all.  You
                may think the stream could easily track the number of bytes it
                wrote, which would eliminate the need for this. But, there is the
                case where the stream writes a complete block, and it is full, and
                then writes no more. In that case the stream may want to check.

                 To "process" the byte means to do the run-length encoding.
                 There are 3 possible return values:
            
                    0 - the byte was not written, in other words, not
                        encoded into the block. This happens when the
                        byte b would require the start of a new run, and
                        the block has no more room for new runs.
            
                    1 - the byte was written, and the block is not full.
            
                    2 - the byte was written, and the block is full.

                 succeeds. The return value indicates whether the block is full:

               This property sets an upper limit on the number of concurrent worker
               threads to employ for compression. The implementation of this stream
               employs multiple threads from the .NET thread pool, via <see
               cref="M:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(System.Threading.WaitCallback)">
               ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem()</see>, to compress the incoming data by
               block.  As each block of data is compressed, this stream re-orders the
               compressed blocks and writes them to the output stream.

             <para>
               A higher number of workers enables a higher degree of
               parallelism, which tends to increase the speed of compression on
               multi-cpu computers.  On the other hand, a higher number of buffer
               pairs also implies a larger memory consumption, more active worker
               threads, and a higher cpu utilization for any compression. This
               property enables the application to limit its memory consumption and
               CPU utilization behavior depending on requirements.

               By default, DotNetZip allocates 4 workers per CPU core, subject to the
               upper limit specified in this property. For example, suppose the
               application sets this property to 16.  Then, on a machine with 2
               cores, DotNetZip will use 8 workers; that number does not exceed the
               upper limit specified by this property, so the actual number of
               workers used will be 4 * 2 = 8.  On a machine with 4 cores, DotNetZip
               will use 16 workers; again, the limit does not apply. On a machine
               with 8 cores, DotNetZip will use 16 workers, because of the limit.

               For each compression "worker thread" that occurs in parallel, there is
               up to 2mb of memory allocated, for buffering and processing. The
               actual number depends on the <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.BZip.ParallelBZip2OutputStream.BlockSize"/> property.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               CPU utilization will also go up with additional workers, because a
               larger number of buffer pairs allows a larger number of background
               threads to compress in parallel. If you find that parallel
               compression is consuming too much memory or CPU, you can adjust this
               value downward.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The default value is 16. Different values may deliver better or

               specification, but rather imply the use of a vendor-specific extension from
               WinZip. If you want to produce interoperable Zip archives, do not use these
               values.  For example, if you produce a zip archive using WinZipAes256, you
               will be able to open it in Windows Explorer on Windows XP and Vista, but you
               will not be able to extract entries; trying this will lead to an "unspecified
               error". For this reason, some people have said that a zip archive that uses
               WinZip's AES encryption is not actually a zip archive at all.  A zip archive
               produced this way will be readable with the WinZip tool (Version 11 and

               that use DotNetZip to read zip archives will be able to read AES-encrypted
               archives produced by those tools or libraries.  Consult the documentation for

               In case you care: According to <see

               actual AES key used is derived from the <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.Password"/> via an
               algorithm that complies with <see
               href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt">RFC 2898</see>, using an iteration
               count of 1000.  The algorithm is sometimes referred to as PBKDF2, which stands
               for "Password Based Key Derivation Function #2".

             <para>
               A word about password strength and length: The AES encryption technology is
               very good, but any system is only as secure as the weakest link.  If you want
               to secure your data, be sure to use a password that is hard to guess.  To make
               it harder to guess (increase its "entropy"), you should make it longer.  If
               you use normal characters from an ASCII keyboard, a password of length 20 will
               be strong enough that it will be impossible to guess.  For more information on
               that, I'd encourage you to read <see

               rules: * implies one or more of any character, while ?  implies one
               character.  If the name pattern contains any slashes, it is matched to
               the entire filename, including the path; otherwise, it is matched
               against only the filename without the path.  This means a pattern of
               "*\*.*" matches all files one directory level deep, while a pattern of
               "*.*" matches all files in all directories.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               To specify a name pattern that includes spaces, use single quotes
               around the pattern.  A pattern of "'* *.*'" will match all files that
               have spaces in the filename.  The full criteria string for that would
               be "name = '* *.*'" .

               The value for a type criterion is either F (implying a file) or D

               You can combine criteria with the conjunctions AND, OR, and XOR. Using
               a string like "name = *.txt AND size &gt;= 100k" for the
               selectionCriteria retrieves entries whose names end in .txt, and whose
               uncompressed size is greater than or equal to 100 kilobytes.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               For more complex combinations of criteria, you can use parenthesis to
               group clauses in the boolean logic.  Absent parenthesis, the
               precedence of the criterion atoms is determined by order of
               appearance.  Unlike the C# language, the AND conjunction does not take
               precendence over the logical OR.  This is important only in strings
               that contain 3 or more criterion atoms.  In other words, "name = *.txt
               and size &gt; 1000 or attributes = H" implies "((name = *.txt AND size
               &gt; 1000) OR attributes = H)" while "attributes = H OR name = *.txt
               and size &gt; 1000" evaluates to "((attributes = H OR name = *.txt)
               AND size &gt; 1000)".  When in doubt, use parenthesis.

               Using time properties requires some extra care. If you want to
               retrieve all entries that were last updated on 2009 February 14,
               specify "mtime &gt;= 2009-02-14 AND mtime &lt; 2009-02-15".  Read this
               to say: all files updated after 12:00am on February 14th, until
               12:00am on February 15th.  You can use the same bracketing approach to
               specify any time period - a year, a month, a week, and so on.

             <para>
               The syntax allows one special case: if you provide a string with no
               spaces, it is treated as a pattern to match for the filename.
               Therefore a string like "*.xls" will be equivalent to specifying "name
               = *.xls".  This "shorthand" notation does not work with compound
               criteria.

               There is no logic in this class that insures that the inclusion
               criteria are internally consistent.  For example, it's possible to
               specify criteria that says the file must have a size of less than 100
               bytes, as well as a size that is greater than 1000 bytes.  Obviously
               no file will ever satisfy such criteria, but this class does not check
               for or detect such inconsistencies.

              <para>
                In some cases, it is not possible to get the Position of a stream, let's
                say, on a write-only output stream like ASP.NET's
                <c>Response.OutputStream</c>, or on a different write-only stream
                provided as the destination for the zip by the application.  In this
                case, programmers can use this counting stream to count the bytes read
                or written.

                Consider the scenario of an application that saves a self-extracting
                archive (SFX), that uses a custom SFX stub.
              </para>
              <para>
                Saving to a filesystem file, the application would open the
                filesystem file (getting a <c>FileStream</c>), save the custom sfx stub
                into it, and then call <c>ZipFile.Save()</c>, specifying the same
                FileStream. <c>ZipFile.Save()</c> does the right thing for the zipentry
                offsets, by inquiring the Position of the <c>FileStream</c> before writing
                any data, and then adding that initial offset into any ZipEntry
                offsets in the zip directory. Everything works fine.
              </para>
              <para>
                Now suppose the application is an ASPNET application and it saves
                directly to <c>Response.OutputStream</c>. It's not possible for DotNetZip to
                inquire the <c>Position</c>, so the offsets for the SFX will be wrong.
              </para>
              <para>
                The workaround is for the application to use this class to wrap
                <c>HttpResponse.OutputStream</c>, then write the SFX stub and the ZipFile
                into that wrapper stream. Because <c>ZipFile.Save()</c> can inquire the
                <c>Position</c>, it will then do the right thing with the offsets.

               Most uses of the DotNetZip library will not involve direct calls into
               the ZipCrypto class.  Instead, the ZipCrypto class is instantiated and
               used by the ZipEntry() class when encryption or decryption on an entry
               is employed.  If for some reason you really wanted to use a weak
               encryption algorithm in some other application, you might use this
               library.  But you would be much better off using one of the built-in
               strong encryption libraries in the .NET Framework, like the AES
               algorithm or SHA.

                 are rounded to the nearest even second. For example, if the time on the

                 is accessible via the <c>LastModified</c> property. This value is always

               Zip tools and libraries will always at least handle (read or write) the

               while the names refer to particular operating systems, there is nothing in

               systems.

               When reading ZIP files, the DotNetZip library reads the Windows-formatted
               time, if it is stored in the entry, and sets both <c>LastModified</c> and
               <c>ModifiedTime</c> to that value. When writing ZIP files, the DotNetZip
               library by default will write both time quantities. It can also emit the
               Unix-formatted time if desired (See <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.EmitTimesInUnixFormatWhenSaving"/>.)

               The last modified time of the file created upon a call to

               for differences in how the .NET Base Class Library deals with daylight
               saving time (DST) versus how the Windows filesystem deals with daylight
               saving time.  Raymond Chen <see
               href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/24/55413.aspx">provides

             <para>
               In a nutshell: Daylight savings time rules change regularly.  In 2007, for
               example, the inception week of DST changed.  In 1977, DST was in place all
               year round. In 1945, likewise.  And so on.  Win32 does not attempt to
               guess which time zone rules were in effect at the time in question.  It
               will render a time as "standard time" and allow the app to change to DST
               as necessary.  .NET makes a different choice.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Compare the output of FileInfo.LastWriteTime.ToString("f") with what you
               see in the Windows Explorer property sheet for a file that was last
               written to on the other side of the DST transition. For example, suppose
               the file was last modified on October 17, 2003, during DST but DST is not
               currently in effect. Explorer's file properties reports Thursday, October
               17, 2003, 8:45:38 AM, but .NETs FileInfo reports Thursday, October 17,
               2003, 9:45 AM.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Win32 says, "Thursday, October 17, 2002 8:45:38 AM PST". Note: Pacific
               STANDARD Time. Even though October 17 of that year occurred during Pacific
               Daylight Time, Win32 displays the time as standard time because that's
               what time it is NOW.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               .NET BCL assumes that the current DST rules were in place at the time in
               question.  So, .NET says, "Well, if the rules in effect now were also in
               effect on October 17, 2003, then that would be daylight time" so it
               displays "Thursday, October 17, 2003, 9:45 AM PDT" - daylight time.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               So .NET gives a value which is more intuitively correct, but is also
               potentially incorrect, and which is not invertible. Win32 gives a value
               which is intuitively incorrect, but is strictly correct.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Because of this funkiness, this library adds one hour to the LastModified
               time on the extracted file, if necessary.  That is to say, if the time in
               question had occurred in what the .NET Base Class Library assumed to be
               DST. This assumption may be wrong given the constantly changing DST rules,
               but it is the best we can do.

             <para>
               Let me explain. It's going to take a while, so get
               comfortable. Originally, waaaaay back in 1989 when the ZIP specification
               was originally described by the esteemed Mr. Phil Katz, the dominant
               operating system of the time was MS-DOS. MSDOS stored file times with a
               2-second precision, because, c'mon, <em>who is ever going to need better
               resolution than THAT?</em> And so ZIP files, regardless of the platform on
               which the zip file was created, store file times in exactly <see
               href="http://www.vsft.com/hal/dostime.htm">the same format that DOS used
               in 1989</see>.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Since then, the ZIP spec has evolved, but the internal format for file
               timestamps remains the same.  Despite the fact that the way times are
               stored in a zip file is rooted in DOS heritage, any program on any
               operating system can format a time in this way, and most zip tools and
               libraries DO - they round file times to the nearest even second and store
               it just like DOS did 25+ years ago.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               PKWare extended the ZIP specification to allow a zip file to store what
               are called "NTFS Times" and "Unix(tm) times" for a file.  These are the
               <em>last write</em>, <em>last access</em>, and <em>file creation</em>
               times of a particular file. These metadata are not actually specific
               to NTFS or Unix. They are tracked for each file by NTFS and by various
               Unix filesystems, but they are also tracked by other filesystems, too.
               The key point is that the times are <em>formatted in the zip file</em>
               in the same way that NTFS formats the time (ticks since win32 epoch),
               or in the same way that Unix formats the time (seconds since Unix
               epoch). As with the DOS time, any tool or library running on any
               operating system is capable of formatting a time in one of these ways
               and embedding it into the zip file.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               These extended times are higher precision quantities than the DOS time.
               As described above, the (DOS) LastModified has a precision of 2 seconds.
               The Unix time is stored with a precision of 1 second. The NTFS time is
               stored with a precision of 0.0000001 seconds. The quantities are easily
               convertible, except for the loss of precision you may incur.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               A zip archive can store the {C,A,M} times in NTFS format, in Unix format,
               or not at all.  Often a tool running on Unix or Mac will embed the times
               in Unix format (1 second precision), while WinZip running on Windows might
               embed the times in NTFS format (precision of of 0.0000001 seconds).  When
               reading a zip file with these "extended" times, in either format,
               DotNetZip represents the values with the
               <c>ModifiedTime</c>, <c>AccessedTime</c> and <c>CreationTime</c>
               properties on the <c>ZipEntry</c>.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               While any zip application or library, regardless of the platform it
               runs on, could use any of the time formats allowed by the ZIP
               specification, not all zip tools or libraries do support all these
               formats.  Storing the higher-precision times for each entry is
               optional for zip files, and many tools and libraries don't use the
               higher precision quantities at all. The old DOS time, represented by
               <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.LastModified"/>, is guaranteed to be present, though it
               sometimes unset.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Ok, getting back to the question about how the <c>LastModified</c>
               property relates to this <c>ModifiedTime</c>
               property... <c>LastModified</c> is always set, while
               <c>ModifiedTime</c> is not. (The other times stored in the <em>NTFS
               times extension</em>, <c>CreationTime</c> and <c>AccessedTime</c> also
               may not be set on an entry that is read from an existing zip file.)
               When reading a zip file, then <c>LastModified</c> takes the DOS time
               that is stored with the file. If the DOS time has been stored as zero
               in the zipfile, then this library will use <c>DateTime.Now</c> for the
               <c>LastModified</c> value.  If the ZIP file was created by an evolved
               tool, then there will also be higher precision NTFS or Unix times in
               the zip file.  In that case, this library will read those times, and
               set <c>LastModified</c> and <c>ModifiedTime</c> to the same value, the
               one corresponding to the last write time of the file.  If there are no
               higher precision times stored for the entry, then <c>ModifiedTime</c>
               remains unset (likewise <c>AccessedTime</c> and <c>CreationTime</c>),
               and <c>LastModified</c> keeps its DOS time.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               When creating zip files with this library, by default the extended time
               properties (<c>ModifiedTime</c>, <c>AccessedTime</c>, and
               <c>CreationTime</c>) are set on the ZipEntry instance, and these data are
               stored in the zip archive for each entry, in NTFS format. If you add an
               entry from an actual filesystem file, then the entry gets the actual file
               times for that file, to NTFS-level precision.  If you add an entry from a
               stream, or a string, then the times get the value <c>DateTime.Now</c>.  In
               this case <c>LastModified</c> and <c>ModifiedTime</c> will be identical,
               to 2 seconds of precision.  You can explicitly set the
               <c>CreationTime</c>, <c>AccessedTime</c>, and <c>ModifiedTime</c> of an
               entry using the property setters.  If you want to set all of those
               quantities, it's more efficient to use the <see
               cref="M:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.SetEntryTimes(System.DateTime,System.DateTime,System.DateTime)"/> method.  Those
               changes are not made permanent in the zip file until you call <see
               cref="M:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.Save"/> or one of its cousins.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               When creating a zip file, you can override the default behavior of
               this library for formatting times in the zip file, disabling the
               embedding of file times in NTFS format or enabling the storage of file
               times in Unix format, or both.  You may want to do this, for example,
               when creating a zip file on Windows, that will be consumed on a Mac,
               by an application that is not hip to the "NTFS times" format. To do
               this, use the <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.EmitTimesInWindowsFormatWhenSaving"/> and
               <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.EmitTimesInUnixFormatWhenSaving"/> properties.  A valid zip
               file may store the file times in both formats.  But, there are no
               guarantees that a program running on Mac or Linux will gracefully
               handle the NTFS-formatted times when Unix times are present, or that a
               non-DotNetZip-powered application running on Windows will be able to
               handle file times in Unix format. DotNetZip will always do something
               reasonable; other libraries or tools may not. When in doubt, test.

               The <see cref="T:System.IO.FileAttributes">attributes</see> in NTFS include
               ReadOnly, Archive, Hidden, System, and Indexed.  When adding a
               <c>ZipEntry</c> to a ZipFile, these attributes are set implicitly when
               adding an entry from the filesystem.  When adding an entry from a stream
               or string, the Attributes are not set implicitly.  Regardless of the way
               an entry was added to a <c>ZipFile</c>, you can set the attributes
               explicitly if you like.

             <para>
               When reading a <c>ZipEntry</c> from a <c>ZipFile</c>, the attributes are
               set according to the data stored in the <c>ZipFile</c>. If you extract the
               entry from the archive to a filesystem file, DotNetZip will set the
               attributes on the resulting file accordingly.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The attributes can be set explicitly by the application.  For example the
               application may wish to set the <c>FileAttributes.ReadOnly</c> bit for all
               entries added to an archive, so that on unpack, this attribute will be set
               on the extracted file.  Any changes you make to this property are made
               permanent only when you call a <c>Save()</c> method on the <c>ZipFile</c>
               instance that contains the ZipEntry.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               For example, an application may wish to zip up a directory and set the
               ReadOnly bit on every file in the archive, so that upon later extraction,
               the resulting files will be marked as ReadOnly.  Not every extraction tool
               respects these attributes, but if you unpack with DotNetZip, as for
               example in a self-extracting archive, then the attributes will be set as
               they are stored in the <c>ZipFile</c>.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               These attributes may not be interesting or useful if the resulting archive
               is extracted on a non-Windows platform.  How these attributes get used
               upon extraction depends on the platform and tool used.

             <para>
               This property is only partially supported in the Silverlight version
               of the library: applications can read attributes on entries within
               ZipFiles. But extracting entries within Silverlight will not set the

               The application can use this property to set the input stream for an

               creates a <c>ZipFile</c> comprised of content obtained from hundreds of
               files, via calls to <c>AddFile()</c>. The DotNetZip library opens streams
               on these files on a just-in-time basis, only when writing the entry out to
               an external store within the scope of a <c>ZipFile.Save()</c> call.  Only
               one input stream is opened at a time, as each entry is being written out.

               Now imagine a different application that creates a <c>ZipFile</c>

               When creating a zip archive, an application can obtain content for one or

               cref="M:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.AddEntry(System.String,System.IO.Stream)"/> method.  At the time
               of calling that method, the application can supply null as the value of
               the stream parameter.  By doing so, the application indicates to the
               library that it will provide a stream for the entry on a just-in-time
               basis, at the time one of the <c>ZipFile.Save()</c> methods is called and
               the data for the various entries are being compressed and written out.

             <para>
               In this case, the application can set the <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.InputStream"/>
               property, typically within the SaveProgress event (event type: <see

               responsibility to call Close/Dispose on that stream.

               The Zip specification from PKWare defines a set of encryption algorithms,
               and the data formats for the zip archive that support them, and PKWare
               supports those algorithms in the tools it produces. Other vendors of tools
               and libraries, such as WinZip or Xceed, typically support <em>a
               subset</em> of the algorithms specified by PKWare. These tools can
               sometimes support additional different encryption algorithms and data
               formats, not specified by PKWare. The AES Encryption specified and
               supported by WinZip is the most popular example. This library supports a

               There is no common, ubiquitous multi-vendor standard for strong encryption
               within zip files. There is broad support for so-called "traditional" Zip
               encryption, sometimes called Zip 2.0 encryption, as <see
               href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">specified
               by PKWare</see>, but this encryption is considered weak and
               breakable. This library currently supports the Zip 2.0 "weak" encryption,
               and also a stronger WinZip-compatible AES encryption, using either 128-bit
               or 256-bit key strength. If you want DotNetZip to support an algorithm
               that is not currently supported, call the author of this library and maybe
               we can talk business.

               <em>that</em> property when setting encryption. This property takes
               precedence over any <c>Encryption</c> set on the <c>ZipFile</c> itself.
               Typically, you would use the per-entry Encryption when most entries in the
               zip archive use one encryption algorithm, and a few entries use a
               different one.  If all entries in the zip file use the same Encryption,
               then it is simpler to just set this property on the ZipFile itself, when
               creating a zip archive.

               Some comments on updating archives: If you read a <c>ZipFile</c>, you can
               modify the Encryption on an encrypted entry: you can remove encryption
               from an entry that was encrypted; you can encrypt an entry that was not
               encrypted previously; or, you can change the encryption algorithm.  The
               changes in encryption are not made permanent until you call Save() on the
               <c>ZipFile</c>.  To effect changes in encryption, the entry content is
               streamed through several transformations, depending on the modification
               the application has requested. For example if the entry is not encrypted
               and the application sets <c>Encryption</c> to <c>PkzipWeak</c>, then at
               the time of <c>Save()</c>, the original entry is read and decompressed,
               then re-compressed and encrypted.  Conversely, if the original entry is
               encrypted with <c>PkzipWeak</c> encryption, and the application sets the
               <c>Encryption</c> property to <c>WinZipAes128</c>, then at the time of
               <c>Save()</c>, the original entry is decrypted via PKZIP encryption and
               decompressed, then re-compressed and re-encrypted with AES.  This all
               happens automatically within the library, but it can be time-consuming for
               large entries.

               Additionally, when updating archives, it is not possible to change the
               password when changing the encryption algorithm.  To change both the
               algorithm and the password, you need to Save() the zipfile twice.  First
               set the <c>Encryption</c> to None, then call <c>Save()</c>.  Then set the
               <c>Encryption</c> to the new value (not "None"), then call <c>Save()</c>
               once again.

               Consider setting the <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.Encryption"/> property when using a
               password. Answering concerns that the standard password protection
               supported by all zip tools is weak, WinZip has extended the ZIP
               specification with a way to use AES Encryption to protect entries in the
               Zip file. Unlike the "PKZIP 2.0" encryption specified in the PKZIP
               specification, <see href=
               "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES
               Encryption</see> uses a standard, strong, tested, encryption
               algorithm. DotNetZip can create zip archives that use WinZip-compatible
               AES encryption, if you set the <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.Encryption"/> property. But,
               archives created that use AES encryption may not be readable by all other
               tools and libraries. For example, Windows Explorer cannot read a
               "compressed folder" (a zip file) that uses AES encryption, though it can
               read a zip file that uses "PKZIP encryption."

               calling <c>Save()</c> on the <c>ZipFile</c> does not update the password
               on that entry in the archive.  Neither is an exception thrown. Instead,
               what happens during the <c>Save()</c> is the existing entry is copied
               through to the new zip archive, in its original encrypted form. Upon

            <remarks>
              <para>
                The default text encoding used in Zip files for encoding filenames and
                comments is IBM437, which is something like a superset of ASCII.  In
                cases where this is insufficient, applications can specify an
                alternate encoding.
              </para>
              <para>
                When creating a zip file, the usage of the alternate encoding is
                governed by the <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.AlternateEncodingUsage"/> property.
                Typically you would set both properties to tell DotNetZip to employ an
                encoding that is not IBM437 in the zipfile you are creating.
              </para>
              <para>
                Keep in mind that because the ZIP specification states that the only
                valid encodings to use are IBM437 and UTF-8, if you use something
                other than that, then zip tools and libraries may not be able to
                successfully read the zip archive you generate.
              </para>
              <para>
                The zip specification states that applications should presume that
                IBM437 is in use, except when a special bit is set, which indicates
                UTF-8. There is no way to specify an arbitrary code page, within the
                zip file itself. When you create a zip file encoded with gb2312 or
                ibm861 or anything other than IBM437 or UTF-8, then the application
                that reads the zip file needs to "know" which code page to use. In
                some cases, the code page used when reading is chosen implicitly. For
                example, WinRar uses the ambient code page for the host desktop
                operating system. The pitfall here is that if you create a zip in
                Copenhagen and send it to Tokyo, the reader of the zipfile may not be
                able to decode successfully.

               The ZIP format includes a provision for specifying whether an entry in

             </para>
            
             <para>
               To be clear, when reading a zip file, the property value may or may
               not be set, and its value may or may not be valid.  Not all entries
               that you may think of as "text" entries will be so marked, and entries
               marked as "text" are not guaranteed in any way to be text entries.
               Whether the value is set and set correctly depends entirely on the
               application that produced the zip file.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               There are many zip tools available, and when creating zip files, some
               of them "respect" the IsText metadata field, and some of them do not.
               Unfortunately, even when an application tries to do "the right thing",
               it's not always clear what "the right thing" is.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               There's no firm definition of just what it means to be "a text file",
               and the zip specification does not help in this regard. Twenty years
               ago, text was ASCII, each byte was less than 127. IsText meant, all
               bytes in the file were less than 127.  These days, it is not the case
               that all text files have all bytes less than 127.  Any unicode file
               may have bytes that are above 0x7f.  The zip specification has nothing
               to say on this topic. Therefore, it's not clear what IsText really
               means.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               This property merely tells a reading application what is stored in the
               metadata for an entry, without guaranteeing its validity or its
               meaning.

             <para>
               When DotNetZip is used to create a zipfile, it attempts to set this
               field "correctly." For example, if a file ends in ".txt", this field
               will be set. Your application may override that default setting.  When
               writing a zip file, you must set the property before calling
               <c>Save()</c> on the ZipFile.

             <para>
               When reading a zip file, a more general way to decide just what kind
               of file is contained in a particular entry is to use the file type
               database stored in the operating system.  The operating system stores
               a table that says, a file with .jpg extension is a JPG image file, a
               file with a .xml extension is an XML document, a file with a .txt is a
               pure ASCII text document, and so on.  To get this information on

               DotNetZip offers a variety of ways to extract entries from a zip
               file.  This method allows an application to extract an entry by
               reading a <see cref="T:System.IO.Stream"/>.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The return value is of type <see
               cref="T:ScrapperMinDLL.CrcCalculatorStream"/>.  Use it as you would any
               stream for reading.  When an application calls <see
               cref="M:System.IO.Stream.Read(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32)"/> on that stream, it will
               receive data from the zip entry that is decrypted and decompressed
               as necessary.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               <c>CrcCalculatorStream</c> adds one additional feature: it keeps a
               CRC32 checksum on the bytes of the stream as it is read.  The CRC
               value is available in the <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.CrcCalculatorStream.Crc"/> property on the
               <c>CrcCalculatorStream</c>.  When the read is complete, your
               application
               <em>should</em> check this CRC against the <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.Crc"/>
               property on the <c>ZipEntry</c> to validate the content of the
               ZipEntry. You don't have to validate the entry using the CRC, but
               you should, to verify integrity. Check the example for how to do
               this.

             <para>
               If the entry is protected with a password, then you need to provide
               a password prior to calling <see cref="M:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.OpenReader"/>, either by
               setting the <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.Password"/> property on the entry, or the
               <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.Password"/> property on the <c>ZipFile</c>
               itself. Or, you can use <see cref="M:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.OpenReader(System.String)" />, the
               overload of OpenReader that accepts a password parameter.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               If you want to extract entry data into a write-able stream that is
               already opened, like a <see cref="T:System.IO.FileStream"/>, do not
               use this method. Instead, use <see cref="M:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.Extract(System.IO.Stream)"/>.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Your application may use only one stream created by OpenReader() at
               a time, and you should not call other Extract methods before
               completing your reads on a stream obtained from OpenReader().  This
               is because there is really only one source stream for the compressed
               content.  A call to OpenReader() seeks in the source stream, to the
               beginning of the compressed content.  A subsequent call to
               OpenReader() on a different entry will seek to a different position
               in the source stream, as will a call to Extract() or one of its
               overloads.  This will corrupt the state for the decompressing stream
               from the original call to OpenReader().

             <para>
                The <c>OpenReader()</c> method works only when the ZipEntry is
                obtained from an instance of <c>ZipFile</c>. This method will throw
                an exception if the ZipEntry is obtained from a <see

               This is the main type in the DotNetZip class library. This class reads and
               writes zip files, as defined in the <see
               href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">specification
               for zip files described by PKWare</see>.  The compression for this
               implementation is provided by a managed-code version of Zlib, included with
               DotNetZip in the classes in the ScrapperMinDLL. namespace.

               This class provides a general purpose zip file capability.  Use it to read,
               create, or update zip files.  When you want to create zip files using a
               <c>Stream</c> type to write the zip file, you may want to consider the <see
               cref="T:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipOutputStream"/> class.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Both the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> class and the <c>ZipFile</c> class can
               be used to create zip files. Both of them support many of the common zip
               features, including Unicode, different compression methods and levels,
               and ZIP64. They provide very similar performance when creating zip
               files.

             <para>
               The <c>ZipFile</c> class is generally easier to use than
               <c>ZipOutputStream</c> and should be considered a higher-level interface.  For
               example, when creating a zip file via calls to the <c>PutNextEntry()</c> and
               <c>Write()</c> methods on the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> class, the caller is
               responsible for opening the file, reading the bytes from the file, writing
               those bytes into the <c>ZipOutputStream</c>, setting the attributes on the
               <c>ZipEntry</c>, and setting the created, last modified, and last accessed
               timestamps on the zip entry. All of these things are done automatically by a
               call to <see cref="M:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.AddFile(System.String,System.String)">ZipFile.AddFile()</see>.
               For this reason, the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> is generally recommended for use
               only when your application emits arbitrary data, not necessarily data from a
               filesystem file, directly into a zip file, and does so using a <c>Stream</c>
               metaphor.

               Aside from the differences in programming model, there are other
               differences in capability between the two classes.

               This method is handy if you are adding things to zip archive and don't

               added as single entries.  A directory added through this method is added
               recursively: all files and subdirectories contained within the directory
               are added to the <c>ZipFile</c>.

               This example shows how to zip up a set of files into a flat hierarchy,
               regardless of where in the filesystem the files originated. The resulting
               zip archive will contain a toplevel directory named "flat", which itself
               will contain files Readme.txt, MyProposal.docx, and Image1.jpg.  A
               subdirectory under "flat" called SupportFiles will contain all the files
               in the "c:\SupportFiles" directory on disk.

               Note: When you use PKZip encryption, it's normally necessary to
               compute the CRC of the content to be encrypted, before compressing or
               encrypting it. Therefore, when using PKZip encryption with a
               WriteDelegate, the WriteDelegate CAN BE called twice: once to compute
               the CRC, and the second time to potentially compress and
               encrypt. Surprising, but true. This is because PKWARE specified that
               the encryption initialization data depends on the CRC.
               If this happens, for each call of the delegate, your
               application must stream the same entry data in its entirety. If your
               application writes different data during the second call, it will
               result in a corrupt zip file.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The double-read behavior happens with all types of entries, not only
               those that use WriteDelegate. It happens if you add an entry from a
               filesystem file, or using a string, or a stream, or an opener/closer
               pair. But in those cases, DotNetZip takes care of reading twice; in
               the case of the WriteDelegate, the application code gets invoked
               twice. Be aware.

               As you can imagine, this can cause performance problems for large
               streams, and it can lead to correctness problems when you use a
               <c>WriteDelegate</c>. This is a pretty big pitfall.  There are two
               ways to avoid it.  First, and most preferred: don't use PKZIP
               encryption.  If you use the WinZip AES encryption, this problem
               doesn't occur, because the encryption protocol doesn't require the CRC
               up front. Second: if you do choose to use PKZIP encryption, write out
               to a non-seekable stream (like standard output, or the
               Response.OutputStream in an ASP.NET application).  In this case,
               DotNetZip will use an alternative encryption protocol that does not
               rely on the CRC of the content.  This also implies setting bit 3 in
               the zip entry, which still presents problems for some zip tools.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               In the future I may modify DotNetZip to *always* use bit 3 when PKZIP
               encryption is in use.  This seems like a win overall, but there will
               be some work involved.  If you feel strongly about it, visit the
               DotNetZip forums and vote up <see

             processing or transformation of the file contents required before writing,
             the application could use the <c>WriteDelegate</c> to do it, in this way.

             This example uses a named delegate in VB to write data for the given
             ZipEntry (VB9 does not have anonymous delegates). The example here is a bit
             contrived - a simpler way to add the contents of a file to a ZipEntry is to
             simply use the appropriate <c>AddFile()</c> method.  The key scenario for
             which the <c>WriteDelegate</c> makes sense is saving a DataSet, in XML
             format, to the zip file. The DataSet can write XML to a stream, and the
             WriteDelegate is the perfect place to write into the zip file.  There may be
             other data structures that can write to a stream, but cannot be read as a
             stream.  The <c>WriteDelegate</c> would be appropriate for those cases as
             well.
            
             <code lang="VB">
             Private Sub WriteEntry (ByVal name As String, ByVal output As Stream)

               First, let me say that you really don't need to bother with this.  It is
               here to allow for optimizations that you probably won't make! It will work
               fine if you don't set or get this property at all. Ok?

             <para>
               Now that we have <em>that</em> out of the way, the fine print: This
               property affects the size of the buffer that is used for I/O for each
               entry contained in the zip file. When a file is read in to be compressed,
               it uses a buffer given by the size here.  When you update a zip file, the
               data for unmodified entries is copied from the first zip file to the
               other, through a buffer given by the size here.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Changing the buffer size affects a few things: first, for larger buffer
               sizes, the memory used by the <c>ZipFile</c>, obviously, will be larger
               during I/O operations.  This may make operations faster for very much
               larger files.  Last, for any given entry, when you use a larger buffer
               there will be fewer progress events during I/O operations, because there's
               one progress event generated for each time the buffer is filled and then
               emptied.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The default buffer size is 8k.  Increasing the buffer size may speed
               things up as you compress larger files.  But there are no hard-and-fast
               rules here, eh?  You won't know til you test it.  And there will be a
               limit where ever larger buffers actually slow things down.  So as I said
               in the beginning, it's probably best if you don't set or get this property
               at all.

             This example shows how you might set a large buffer size for efficiency when

               <para>
                 When doing ZLIB or Deflate compression, the library fills a buffer,
                 then passes it to the compressor for compression. Then the library
                 reads out the compressed bytes. This happens repeatedly until there
                 is no more uncompressed data to compress. This property sets the
                 size of the buffer that will be used for chunk-wise compression. In
                 order for the setting to take effect, your application needs to set
                 this property before calling one of the <c>ZipFile.Save()</c>

                 Setting this affects the performance and memory efficiency of
                 compression and decompression. For larger files, setting this to a
                 larger size may improve compression performance, but the exact
                 numbers vary depending on available memory, the size of the streams
                 you are compressing, and a bunch of other variables. I don't have
                 good firm recommendations on how to set it.  You'll have to test it
                 yourself. Or just leave it alone and accept the default.

               The specification does not describe how to indicate the encoding used
               on a comment string. Many "compliant" zip tools and libraries use
               IBM437 as the code page for comments; DotNetZip, too, follows that
               practice.  On the other hand, there are situations where you want a
               Comment to be encoded with something else, for example using code page
               950 "Big-5 Chinese". To fill that need, DotNetZip will encode the
               comment following the same procedure it follows for encoding
               filenames: (a) if <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.AlternateEncodingUsage"/> is
               <c>Never</c>, it uses the default encoding (IBM437). (b) if <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.AlternateEncodingUsage"/> is <c>Always</c>, it always uses the
               alternate encoding (<see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.AlternateEncoding"/>). (c) if <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.AlternateEncodingUsage"/> is <c>AsNecessary</c>, it uses the
               alternate encoding only if the default encoding is not sufficient for
               encoding the comment - in other words if decoding the result does not
               produce the original string.  This decision is taken at the time of
               the call to <c>ZipFile.Save()</c>.

               zip file. One is the format Windows applications normally use: 100ns ticks
               since January 1, 1601 UTC.  The other is a format Unix applications typically
               use: seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC.  Each format can be stored in an
               "extra field" in the zip entry when saving the zip archive. The former
               uses an extra field with a Header Id of 0x000A, while the latter uses a

               the encoding according to that specification.  By default, this flag is

               Zip files created with strict adherence to the PKWare specification with
               respect to UTF-8 encoding can contain entries with filenames containing
               any combination of Unicode characters, including the full range of
               characters from Chinese, Latin, Hebrew, Greek, Cyrillic, and many other
               alphabets.  However, because at this time, the UTF-8 portion of the PKWare
               specification is not broadly supported by other zip libraries and
               utilities, such zip files may not be readable by your favorite zip tool or
               archiver. In other words, interoperability will decrease if you set this

               In particular, Zip files created with strict adherence to the PKWare
               specification with respect to UTF-8 encoding will not work well with
               Explorer in Windows XP or Windows Vista, because Windows compressed
               folders, as far as I know, do not support UTF-8 in zip files.  Vista can
               read the zip files, but shows the filenames incorrectly. Unpacking from
               Windows Vista Explorer will result in filenames that have rubbish
               characters in place of the high-order UTF-8 bytes.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Also, zip files that use UTF-8 encoding will not work well with Java
               applications that use the java.util.zip classes, as of v5.0 of the Java
               runtime. The Java runtime does not correctly implement the PKWare
               specification in this regard.

             <para>
               As a result, we have the unfortunate situation that "correct" behavior by
               the DotNetZip library with regard to Unicode encoding of filenames during
               zip creation will result in zip files that are readable by strictly
               compliant and current tools (for example the most recent release of the
               commercial WinZip tool); but these zip files will not be readable by
               various other tools or libraries, including Windows Explorer.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The DotNetZip library can read and write zip files with UTF8-encoded
               entries, according to the PKware spec.  If you use DotNetZip for both
               creating and reading the zip file, and you use UTF-8, there will be no
               loss of information in the filenames. For example, using a self-extractor
               created by this library will allow you to unpack files correctly with no
               loss of information in the filenames.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               If you do not set this flag, it will remain false.  If this flag is false,
               your <c>ZipFile</c> will encode all filenames and comments using the
               IBM437 codepage.  This can cause "loss of information" on some filenames,
               but the resulting zipfile will be more interoperable with other
               utilities. As an example of the loss of information, diacritics can be
               lost.  The o-tilde character will be down-coded to plain o.  The c with a
               cedilla (Unicode 0xE7) used in Portugese will be downcoded to a c.
               Likewise, the O-stroke character (Unicode 248), used in Danish and
               Norwegian, will be down-coded to plain o. Chinese characters cannot be
               represented in codepage IBM437; when using the default encoding, Chinese
               characters in filenames will be represented as ?. These are all examples
               of "information loss".
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The loss of information associated to the use of the IBM437 encoding is
               inconvenient, and can also lead to runtime errors. For example, using
               IBM437, any sequence of 4 Chinese characters will be encoded as ????.  If
               your application creates a <c>ZipFile</c>, then adds two files, each with
               names of four Chinese characters each, this will result in a duplicate
               filename exception.  In the case where you add a single file with a name
               containing four Chinese characters, calling Extract() on the entry that
               has question marks in the filename will result in an exception, because
               the question mark is not legal for use within filenames on Windows.  These
               are just a few examples of the problems associated to loss of information.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               This flag is independent of the encoding of the content within the entries
               in the zip file. Think of the zip file as a container - it supports an
               encoding.  Within the container are other "containers" - the file entries
               themselves.  The encoding within those entries is independent of the
               encoding of the zip archive container for those entries.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Rather than specify the encoding in a binary fashion using this flag, an
               application can specify an arbitrary encoding via the <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding"/> property.  Setting the encoding
               explicitly when creating zip archives will result in non-compliant zip
               files that, curiously, are fairly interoperable.  The challenge is, the
               PKWare specification does not provide for a way to specify that an entry
               in a zip archive uses a code page that is neither IBM437 nor UTF-8.
               Therefore if you set the encoding explicitly when creating a zip archive,
               you must take care upon reading the zip archive to use the same code page.
               If you get it wrong, the behavior is undefined and may result in incorrect

               (950) code page.  This behavior is contrary to the Zip specification, but

               archivers are non-compliant and can read zip files created in arbitrary

               When using an arbitrary, non-UTF8 code page for encoding, there is no
               standard way for the creator application - whether DotNetZip, WinZip,
               WinRar, or something else - to formally specify in the zip file which
               codepage has been used for the entries. As a result, readers of zip files
               are not able to inspect the zip file and determine the codepage that was
               used for the entries contained within it.  It is left to the application
               or user to determine the necessary codepage when reading zip files encoded
               this way.  In other words, if you explicitly specify the codepage when you
               create the zipfile, you must explicitly specify the same codepage when
               reading the zipfile.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The way you specify the code page to use when reading a zip file varies
               depending on the tool or library you use to read the zip.  In DotNetZip,
               you use a ZipFile.Read() method that accepts an encoding parameter.  It
               isn't possible with Windows Explorer, as far as I know, to specify an
               explicit codepage to use when reading a zip.  If you use an incorrect
               codepage when reading a zipfile, you will get entries with filenames that
               are incorrect, and the incorrect filenames may even contain characters
               that are not legal for use within filenames in Windows. Extracting entries
               with illegal characters in the filenames will lead to exceptions. It's too
               bad, but this is just the way things are with code pages in zip
               files. Caveat Emptor.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Example: Suppose you create a zipfile that contains entries with
               filenames that have Danish characters.  If you use <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding" /> equal to "iso-8859-1" (cp 28591),
               the filenames will be correctly encoded in the zip.  But, to read that
               zipfile correctly, you have to specify the same codepage at the time you
               read it. If try to read that zip file with Windows Explorer or another
               application that is not flexible with respect to the codepage used to
               decode filenames in zipfiles, you will get a filename like "Inf°.txt".

             <para>
               When using DotNetZip to read a zip archive, and the zip archive uses an
               arbitrary code page, you must specify the encoding to use before or when
               the <c>Zipfile</c> is READ.  This means you must use a <c>ZipFile.Read()</c>
               method that allows you to specify a System.Text.Encoding parameter.  Setting
               the ProvisionalAlternateEncoding property after your application has read in
               the zip archive will not affect the entry names of entries that have already
               been read in.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               And now, the exception to the rule described above.  One strategy for
               specifying the code page for a given zip file is to describe the code page
               in a human-readable form in the Zip comment. For example, the comment may
               read "Entries in this archive are encoded in the Big5 code page".  For
               maximum interoperability, the zip comment in this case should be encoded
               in the default, IBM437 code page.  In this case, the zip comment is
               encoded using a different page than the filenames.  To do this, Specify
               <c>ProvisionalAlternateEncoding</c> to your desired region-specific code
               page, once before adding any entries, and then reset
               <c>ProvisionalAlternateEncoding</c> to IBM437 before setting the <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.Comment"/> property and calling Save().

             <example>
             This example shows how to read a zip file using the Big-5 Chinese code page
             (950), and extract each entry in the zip file.  For this code to work as
             desired, the <c>Zipfile</c> must have been created using the big5 code page
             (CP950). This is typical, for example, when using WinRar on a machine with
             CP950 set as the default code page.  In that case, the names of entries
             within the Zip archive will be stored in that code page, and reading the zip
             archive must be done using that code page.  If the application did not use
             the correct code page in <c>ZipFile.Read()</c>, then names of entries within the
             zip archive would not be correctly retrieved.

             <remarks>
            
             <para>
               When writing a zip archive, this password is applied to the entries, not
               to the zip archive itself. It applies to any <c>ZipEntry</c> subsequently
               added to the <c>ZipFile</c>, using one of the <c>AddFile</c>,
               <c>AddDirectory</c>, <c>AddEntry</c>, or <c>AddItem</c> methods, etc.
               When reading a zip archive, this property applies to any entry
               subsequently extracted from the <c>ZipFile</c> using one of the Extract
               methods on the <c>ZipFile</c> class.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               When writing a zip archive, keep this in mind: though the password is set
               on the ZipFile object, according to the Zip spec, the "directory" of the
               archive - in other words the list of entries or files contained in the archive - is
               not encrypted with the password, or protected in any way.  If you set the
               Password property, the password actually applies to individual entries
               that are added to the archive, subsequent to the setting of this property.
               The list of filenames in the archive that is eventually created will
               appear in clear text, but the contents of the individual files are
               encrypted.  This is how Zip encryption works.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               One simple way around this limitation is to simply double-wrap sensitive
               filenames: Store the files in a zip file, and then store that zip file
               within a second, "outer" zip file.  If you apply a password to the outer
               zip file, then readers will be able to see that the outer zip file
               contains an inner zip file.  But readers will not be able to read the
               directory or file list of the inner zip file.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               If you set the password on the <c>ZipFile</c>, and then add a set of files
               to the archive, then each entry is encrypted with that password.  You may
               also want to change the password between adding different entries. If you
               set the password, add an entry, then set the password to <c>null</c>
               (<c>Nothing</c> in VB), and add another entry, the first entry is
               encrypted and the second is not.  If you call <c>AddFile()</c>, then set
               the <c>Password</c> property, then call <c>ZipFile.Save</c>, the file
               added will not be password-protected, and no warning will be generated.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               When setting the Password, you may also want to explicitly set the <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.Encryption"/> property, to specify how to encrypt the entries added
               to the ZipFile.  If you set the Password to a non-null value and do not
               set <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.Encryption"/>, then PKZip 2.0 ("Weak") encryption is used.
               This encryption is relatively weak but is very interoperable. If you set
               the password to a <c>null</c> value (<c>Nothing</c> in VB), Encryption is
               reset to None.

               All of the preceding applies to writing zip archives, in other words when
               you use one of the Save methods.  To use this property when reading or an
               existing ZipFile, do the following: set the Password property on the
               <c>ZipFile</c>, then call one of the Extract() overloads on the <see
               cref="T:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry" />. In this case, the entry is extracted using the
               <c>Password</c> that is specified on the <c>ZipFile</c> instance. If you
               have not set the <c>Password</c> property, then the password is
               <c>null</c>, and the entry is extracted with no password.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               If you set the Password property on the <c>ZipFile</c>, then call
               <c>Extract()</c> an entry that has not been encrypted with a password, the
               password is not used for that entry, and the <c>ZipEntry</c> is extracted
               as normal. In other words, the password is used only if necessary.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The <see cref="T:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry"/> class also has a <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.Password">Password</see> property.  It takes precedence
               over this property on the <c>ZipFile</c>.  Typically, you would use the
               per-entry Password when most entries in the zip archive use one password,
               and a few entries use a different password.  If all entries in the zip
               file use the same password, then it is simpler to just set this property
               on the <c>ZipFile</c> itself, whether creating a zip archive or extracting
               a zip archive.

               <c>Save</c>. This may be useful if the application wants to favor
               speed over size, and wants to defer the decision until the time of

               Typically applications set the <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.CompressionLevel"/> property on
               the <c>ZipFile</c> or on each <c>ZipEntry</c> to determine the level of
               compression used. This is done at the time the entry is added to the

               <c>ScrapperMinDLL..CompressionLevel.None</c> means no compression will be used.

             <para>
               This callback allows the application to defer the decision on the
               <c>CompressionLevel</c> to use, until the time of the call to
               <c>ZipFile.Save()</c>. The callback is invoked once per <c>ZipEntry</c>,
               at the time the data for the entry is being written out as part of a
               <c>Save()</c> operation. The application can use whatever criteria it
               likes in determining the level to return.  For example, an application may
               wish that no .mp3 files should be compressed, because they are already
               compressed and the extra compression is not worth the CPU time incurred,

               and the <c>CompressionLevel</c> is set to the return value. If this

                 A split zip archive is saved in a set of discrete filesystem files,
                 rather than in a single file. This is handy when transmitting the
                 archive in email or some other mechanism that has a limit to the size of
                 each file.  The first file in a split archive will be named
                 <c>basename.z01</c>, the second will be named <c>basename.z02</c>, and
                 so on. The final file is named <c>basename.zip</c>. According to the zip
                 specification from PKWare, the minimum value is 65536, for a 64k segment
                 size. The maximum number of segments allows in a split archive is 99.

                 The value of this property determines the maximum size of a split
                 segment when writing a split archive.  For example, suppose you have a
                 <c>ZipFile</c> that would save to a single file of 200k. If you set the
                 <c>MaxOutputSegmentSize</c> to 65536 before calling <c>Save()</c>, you
                 will get four distinct output files. On the other hand if you set this
                 property to 256k, then you will get a single-file archive for that
                 <c>ZipFile</c>.

                 The size of each split output file will be as large as possible, up to
                 the maximum size set here. The zip specification requires that some data
                 fields in a zip archive may not span a split boundary, and an output
                 segment may be smaller than the maximum if necessary to avoid that
                 problem. Also, obviously the final segment of the archive may be smaller
                 than the maximum segment size. Segments will never be larger than the
                 value set with this property.

                 DotNetZip will use multiple threads to compress any ZipEntry,
                 if the entry is larger than the given size.  Zero means "always
                 use parallel deflate", while -1 means "never use parallel
                 deflate". The default value for this property is 512k. Aside
                 from the special values of 0 and 1, the minimum value is 65536.

                 If the entry size cannot be known before compression, as with a
                 read-forward stream, then Parallel deflate will never be
                 performed, unless the value of this property is zero.

                 A parallel deflate operations will speed up the compression of
                 large files, on computers with multiple CPUs or multiple CPU
                 cores.  For files above 1mb, on a dual core or dual-cpu (2p)
                 machine, the time required to compress the file can be 70% of the
                 single-threaded deflate.  For very large files on 4p machines the
                 compression can be done in 30% of the normal time.  The downside
                 is that parallel deflate consumes extra memory during the deflate,
                 and the deflation is not as effective.

               <para>
                 Parallel deflate tends to yield slightly less compression when
                 compared to as single-threaded deflate; this is because the original
                 data stream is split into multiple independent buffers, each of which
                 is compressed in parallel.  But because they are treated
                 independently, there is no opportunity to share compression
                 dictionaries.  For that reason, a deflated stream may be slightly
                 larger when compressed using parallel deflate, as compared to a
                 traditional single-threaded deflate. Sometimes the increase over the
                 normal deflate is as much as 5% of the total compressed size. For
                 larger files it can be as small as 0.1%.

                 Multi-threaded compression does not give as much an advantage when
                 using Encryption. This is primarily because encryption tends to slow
                 down the entire pipeline. Also, multi-threaded compression gives less
                 of an advantage when using lower compression levels, for example <see
                 cref="!:ScrapperMinDLL..CompressionLevel.BestSpeed"/>.  You may have to
                 perform some tests to determine the best approach for your situation.

               This property sets an upper limit on the number of memory
               buffer pairs to create when performing parallel
               compression.  The implementation of the parallel
               compression stream allocates multiple buffers to
               facilitate parallel compression.  As each buffer fills up,
               the stream uses <see
               cref="M:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(System.Threading.WaitCallback)">
               ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem()</see> to compress those
               buffers in a background threadpool thread. After a buffer
               is compressed, it is re-ordered and written to the output
               stream.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               A higher number of buffer pairs enables a higher degree of
               parallelism, which tends to increase the speed of compression on
               multi-cpu computers.  On the other hand, a higher number of buffer
               pairs also implies a larger memory consumption, more active worker
               threads, and a higher cpu utilization for any compression. This
               property enables the application to limit its memory consumption and
               CPU utilization behavior depending on requirements.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               For each compression "task" that occurs in parallel, there are 2
               buffers allocated: one for input and one for output.  This property
               sets a limit for the number of pairs.  The total amount of storage
               space allocated for buffering will then be (N*S*2), where N is the
               number of buffer pairs, S is the size of each buffer (<see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile.BufferSize"/>).  By default, DotNetZip allocates 4 buffer
               pairs per CPU core, so if your machine has 4 cores, and you retain
               the default buffer size of 128k, then the
               ParallelDeflateOutputStream will use 4 * 4 * 2 * 128kb of buffer
               memory in total, or 4mb, in blocks of 128kb.  If you then set this
               property to 8, then the number will be 8 * 2 * 128kb of buffer
               memory, or 2mb.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               CPU utilization will also go up with additional buffers, because a
               larger number of buffer pairs allows a larger number of background
               threads to compress in parallel. If you find that parallel
               compression is consuming too much memory or CPU, you can adjust this
               value downward.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The default value is 16. Different values may deliver better or
               worse results, depending on your priorities and the dynamic
               performance characteristics of your storage and compute resources.

               This property is not the number of buffer pairs to use; it is an
               upper limit. An illustration: Suppose you have an application that
               uses the default value of this property (which is 16), and it runs
               on a machine with 2 CPU cores. In that case, DotNetZip will allocate
               4 buffer pairs per CPU core, for a total of 8 pairs.  The upper
               limit specified by this property has no effect.

               This is because DotNetZip performs a normalization of filenames passed to

               includes: removal of a volume letter and colon, swapping backward slashes
               for forward slashes.  So, <c>zip["dir1\\entry1.txt"].FileName ==

               Fired just after renaming the temporary file to the permanent
               location.  This happens only when saving to a disk file.  This event
               will not be invoked when saving to a stream.

             <description>
               Set during the save of a particular entry, to update progress of the
               Save().  When this EventType is set, the BytesTransferred is the
               number of bytes that have been read from the source stream.  The
               TotalBytesToTransfer is the number of bytes in the uncompressed
               file.

                 Adding a large number of entries to a zip file can take a long

                 Errors can occur as a file is being saved to the zip archive.  For
                 example, the File.Open may fail, or a File.Read may fail, because of
                 lock conflicts or other reasons.  If you add a handler to this event,
                 you can handle such errors in your own code.  If you don't add a
                 handler, the library will throw an exception if it encounters an I/O
                 error during a call to <c>Save()</c>.

                The handler you add applies to all <see cref="T:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry"/> items that are
                subsequently added to the <c>ZipFile</c> instance. If you set this
                property after you have added items to the <c>ZipFile</c>, but before you
                have called <c>Save()</c>, errors that occur while saving those items
                will not cause the error handler to be invoked.

                If you want to handle any errors that occur with any entry in the zip
                file using the same error handler, then add your error handler once,
                before adding any entries to the zip archive.

                In the error handler method, you need to set the <see
                cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipEntry.ZipErrorAction"/> property on the
                <c>ZipErrorEventArgs.CurrentEntry</c>.  This communicates back to
                DotNetZip what you would like to do with this particular error.  Within
                an error handler, if you set the <c>ZipEntry.ZipErrorAction</c> property
                on the <c>ZipEntry</c> to <c>ZipErrorAction.InvokeErrorEvent</c> or if
                you don't set it at all, the library will throw the exception. (It is the
                same as if you had set the <c>ZipEntry.ZipErrorAction</c> property on the
                <c>ZipEntry</c> to <c>ZipErrorAction.Throw</c>.) If you set the
                <c>ZipErrorEventArgs.Cancel</c> to true, the entire <c>Save()</c> will be
                canceled.

                In the case that you use <c>ZipErrorAction.Skip</c>, implying that
                you want to skip the entry for which there's been an error, DotNetZip
                tries to seek backwards in the output stream, and truncate all bytes
                written on behalf of that particular entry. This works only if the
                output stream is seekable.  It will not work, for example, when using

               If an extraction of a file from the zip archive would overwrite an

               About timestamps: When extracting a file entry from a zip archive, the
               extracted file gets the last modified time of the entry as stored in
               the archive. The archive may also store extended file timestamp
               information, including last accessed and created times. If these are
               present in the <c>ZipEntry</c>, then the extracted file will also get
               these times.

             <para>
               A Directory entry is somewhat different. It will get the times as
               described for a file entry, but, if there are file entries in the zip
               archive that, when extracted, appear in the just-created directory,
               then when those file entries are extracted, the last modified and last
               accessed times of the directory will change, as a side effect.  The
               result is that after an extraction of a directory and a number of
               files within the directory, the last modified and last accessed
               timestamps on the directory will reflect the time that the last file
               was extracted into the directory, rather than the time stored in the
               zip archive for the directory.

               To compensate, when extracting an archive with <c>ExtractAll</c>,
               DotNetZip will extract all the file and directory entries as described
               above, but it will then make a second pass on the directories, and
               reset the times on the directories to reflect what is stored in the

               This compensation is performed only within the context of an
               <c>ExtractAll</c>. If you call <c>ZipEntry.Extract</c> on a directory
               entry, the timestamps on directory in the filesystem will reflect the
               times stored in the zip.  If you then call <c>ZipEntry.Extract</c> on
               a file entry, which is extracted into the directory, the timestamps on
               the directory will be updated to the current time.

               example, when using WinRar on a machine with CP950 set as the
               default code page.  In that case, the names of entries within the

               archive must be done using that code page.  If the application did
               not use the correct code page in ZipFile.Read(), then names of

             Reading of zip content begins at the current position in the stream.  This
             means if you have a stream that concatenates regular data and zip data, if
             you position the open, readable stream at the start of the zip data, you
             will be able to read the zip archive using this constructor, or any of the
             ZipFile constructors that accept a <see cref="T:System.IO.Stream" /> as
             input. Some examples of where this might be useful: the zip content is
             concatenated at the end of a regular EXE file, as some self-extracting
             archives do.  (Note: SFX files produced by DotNetZip do not work this
             way). Another example might be a stream being read from a database, where
             the zip content is embedded within an aggregate stream of data.

             There are two "flavors" of self-extracting archive.  The
             <c>WinFormsApplication</c> version will pop up a GUI and allow the
             user to select a target directory into which to extract. There's also
             a checkbox allowing the user to specify to overwrite existing files,
             and another checkbox to allow the user to request that Explorer be
             opened to see the extracted files after extraction.  The other flavor
             is <c>ConsoleApplication</c>.  A self-extractor generated with that
             flavor setting will run from the command line. It accepts command-line
             options to set the overwrite behavior, and to specify the target
             extraction directory.

             There are a few temporary files created during the saving to a

               operator is "!=", implying "Not Equal".  The value is "*.doc".  That

             The value for a size criterion is expressed in integer quantities of bytes,

             <para>
             The value for a name is a pattern to match against the filename, potentially
             including wildcards.  The pattern follows CMD.exe glob rules: * implies one
             or more of any character, while ?  implies one character.  If the name
             pattern contains any slashes, it is matched to the entire filename,
             including the path; otherwise, it is matched against only the filename
             without the path.  This means a pattern of "*\*.*" matches all files one
             directory level deep, while a pattern of "*.*" matches all files in all
             directories.

             <para>
             To specify a name pattern that includes spaces, use single quotes around the
             pattern.  A pattern of "'* *.*'" will match all files that have spaces in
             the filename.  The full criteria string for that would be "name = '* *.*'" .

             You can combine criteria with the conjunctions AND or OR. Using a string
             like "name = *.txt AND size &gt;= 100k" for the selectionCriteria retrieves
             entries whose names end in .txt, and whose uncompressed size is greater than
             or equal to 100 kilobytes.
             </para>
            
             <para>
             For more complex combinations of criteria, you can use parenthesis to group
             clauses in the boolean logic.  Without parenthesis, the precedence of the
             criterion atoms is determined by order of appearance.  Unlike the C#
             language, the AND conjunction does not take precendence over the logical OR.
             This is important only in strings that contain 3 or more criterion atoms.
             In other words, "name = *.txt and size &gt; 1000 or attributes = H" implies
             "((name = *.txt AND size &gt; 1000) OR attributes = H)" while "attributes =
             H OR name = *.txt and size &gt; 1000" evaluates to "((attributes = H OR name
             = *.txt) AND size &gt; 1000)".  When in doubt, use parenthesis.

             Using time properties requires some extra care. If you want to retrieve all
             entries that were last updated on 2009 February 14, specify a time range
             like so:"mtime &gt;= 2009-02-14 AND mtime &lt; 2009-02-15".  Read this to
             say: all files updated after 12:00am on February 14th, until 12:00am on
             February 15th.  You can use the same bracketing approach to specify any time
             period - a year, a month, a week, and so on.

             <para>
             The syntax allows one special case: if you provide a string with no spaces, it is
             treated as a pattern to match for the filename.  Therefore a string like "*.xls"
             will be equivalent to specifying "name = *.xls".

             There is no logic in this method that insures that the file inclusion
             criteria are internally consistent.  For example, it's possible to specify
             criteria that says the file must have a size of less than 100 bytes, as well
             as a size that is greater than 1000 bytes. Obviously no file will ever
             satisfy such criteria, but this method does not detect such logical
             inconsistencies. The caller is responsible for insuring the criteria are
             sensible.

               subdirectories, and the full path of the selected files is included in the

             <para>
               Designed many years ago, the <see
               href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">original zip
               specification from PKWARE</see> allowed for 32-bit quantities for the
               compressed and uncompressed sizes of zip entries, as well as a 32-bit quantity
               for specifying the length of the zip archive itself, and a maximum of 65535
               entries.  These limits are now regularly exceeded in many backup and archival
               scenarios.  Recently, PKWare added extensions to the original zip spec, called
               "ZIP64 extensions", to raise those limitations.  This property governs whether
               DotNetZip will use those extensions when writing zip archives. The use of
               these extensions is optional and explicit in DotNetZip because, despite the
               status of ZIP64 as a bona fide standard, many other zip tools and libraries do
               not support ZIP64, and therefore a zip file with ZIP64 extensions may be
               unreadable by some of those other tools.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Set this property to <see cref="F:ScrapperMinDLL.Zip64Option.Always"/> to always use ZIP64
               extensions when saving, regardless of whether your zip archive needs it.
               Suppose you add 5 files, each under 100k, to a ZipFile. If you specify Always
               for this flag, you will get a ZIP64 archive, though the archive does not need
               to use ZIP64 because none of the original zip limits had been exceeded.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Set this property to <see cref="F:ScrapperMinDLL.Zip64Option.Never"/> to tell the DotNetZip
               library to never use ZIP64 extensions.  This is useful for maximum
               compatibility and interoperability, at the expense of the capability of
               handling large files or large archives.  NB: Windows Explorer in Windows XP
               and Windows Vista cannot currently extract files from a zip64 archive, so if
               you want to guarantee that a zip archive produced by this library will work in
               Windows Explorer, use <c>Never</c>. If you set this property to <see
               cref="F:ScrapperMinDLL.Zip64Option.Never"/>, and your application creates a zip that would
               exceed one of the Zip limits, the library will throw an exception while saving
               the zip file.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Set this property to <see cref="F:ScrapperMinDLL.Zip64Option.AsNecessary"/> to tell the
               DotNetZip library to use the ZIP64 extensions when required by the
               entry. After the file is compressed, the original and compressed sizes are
               checked, and if they exceed the limits described above, then zip64 can be
               used. That is the general idea, but there is an additional wrinkle when saving
               to a non-seekable device, like the ASP.NET <c>Response.OutputStream</c>, or
               <c>Console.Out</c>.  When using non-seekable streams for output, the entry
               header - which indicates whether zip64 is in use - is emitted before it is
               known if zip64 is necessary.  It is only after all entries have been saved
               that it can be known if ZIP64 will be required.  On seekable output streams,
               after saving all entries, the library can seek backward and re-emit the zip
               file header to be consistent with the actual ZIP64 requirement.  But using a
               non-seekable output stream, the library cannot seek backward, so the header
               can never be changed. In other words, the archive's use of ZIP64 extensions is
               not alterable after the header is emitted.  Therefore, when saving to
               non-seekable streams, using <see cref="F:ScrapperMinDLL.Zip64Option.AsNecessary"/> is the same
               as using <see cref="F:ScrapperMinDLL.Zip64Option.Always"/>: it will always produce a zip
               archive that uses ZIP64 extensions.

               If it is non-empty, the SFX will execute the command specified in this

               working directory for the process, after unpacking the archive. The
               program to execute can include a path, if you like. If you want to execute
               a program that accepts arguments, specify the program name, followed by a
               space, and then the arguments for the program, each separated by a space,
               just as you would on a normal command line. Example: <c>program.exe arg1
               arg2</c>.  The string prior to the first space will be taken as the

               If you want to execute a program that has a space in the name or path of
               the file, surround the program name in double-quotes. The first character
               of the command line should be a double-quote character, and there must be
               a matching double-quote following the end of the program file name. Any
               optional arguments to the program follow that, separated by

               then the SFX starts a new process, using this string as the post-extract
               command line.  The SFX waits for the process to exit.  The exit code of
               the post-extract command line is returned as the exit code of the
               command-line self-extractor exe. A non-zero exit code is typically used to
               indicated a failure by the program. In the case of an SFX, a non-zero exit
               code may indicate a failure during extraction, OR, it may indicate a
               failure of the run-after-extract program if specified, OR, it may indicate
               the run-after-extract program could not be fuond. There is no way to

               the output of the SFX. If you have Quiet set to <c>true</c>, you may not

               extract directory as the working directory for the process. The SFX does
               not wait for the command to complete, and does not check the exit code of
               the program. If the run-after-extract program cannot be fuond, a message

               This class provides an alternative programming model for reading zip files to
               the one enabled by the <see cref="T:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile"/> class.  Use this when reading zip
               files, as an alternative to the <see cref="T:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipFile"/> class, when you would
               like to use a Stream class to read the file.

               Some application designs require a readable stream for input. This stream can
               be used to read a zip file, and extract entries.

               Both the <c>ZipInputStream</c> class and the <c>ZipFile</c> class can be used
               to read and extract zip files.  Both of them support many of the common zip
               features, including Unicode, different compression levels, and ZIP64.  The
               programming models differ. For example, when extracting entries via calls to
               the <c>GetNextEntry()</c> and <c>Read()</c> methods on the
               <c>ZipInputStream</c> class, the caller is responsible for creating the file,
               writing the bytes into the file, setting the attributes on the file, and
               setting the created, last modified, and last accessed timestamps on the
               file. All of these things are done automatically by a call to <see

               <c>ZipInputStream</c> is generally recommended for when your application wants

               In <see href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">its
               zip specification</see>, PKWare describes two options for encoding
               filenames and comments: using IBM437 or UTF-8.  But, some archiving tools
               or libraries do not follow the specification, and instead encode
               characters using the system default code page.  For example, WinRAR when
               run on a machine in Shanghai may encode filenames with the Big-5 Chinese
               (950) code page.  This behavior is contrary to the Zip specification, but
               it occurs anyway.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               When using DotNetZip to read zip archives that use something other than
               UTF-8 or IBM437, set this property to specify the code page to use when
               reading encoded filenames and comments for each <c>ZipEntry</c> in the zip
               file.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               This property is "provisional". When the entry in the zip archive is not
               explicitly marked as using UTF-8, then IBM437 is used to decode filenames
               and comments. If a loss of data would result from using IBM436 -
               specifically when encoding and decoding is not reflexive - the codepage
               specified here is used. It is possible, therefore, to have a given entry
               with a <c>Comment</c> encoded in IBM437 and a <c>FileName</c> encoded with
               the specified "provisional" codepage.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               When a zip file uses an arbitrary, non-UTF8 code page for encoding, there
               is no standard way for the reader application - whether DotNetZip, WinZip,
               WinRar, or something else - to know which codepage has been used for the
               entries. Readers of zip files are not able to inspect the zip file and
               determine the codepage that was used for the entries contained within it.
               It is left to the application or user to determine the necessary codepage
               when reading zip files encoded this way.  If you use an incorrect codepage
               when reading a zipfile, you will get entries with filenames that are
               incorrect, and the incorrect filenames may even contain characters that
               are not legal for use within filenames in Windows. Extracting entries with
               illegal characters in the filenames will lead to exceptions. It's too bad,
               but this is just the way things are with code pages in zip files. Caveat
               Emptor.

               recommendations on how to set it.  You'll have to test it yourself. Or
               just leave it alone and accept the default.

               Both the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> class and the <c>ZipFile</c> class can be used

               The <c>ZipFile</c> class is generally easier to use than
               <c>ZipOutputStream</c> and should be considered a higher-level interface.  For

               <c>Write()</c> methods on the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> class, the caller is
               responsible for opening the file, reading the bytes from the file, writing
               those bytes into the <c>ZipOutputStream</c>, setting the attributes on the

               For this reason, the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> is generally recommended for use
               only when your application emits arbitrary data, not necessarily data from a
               filesystem file, directly into a zip file, and does so using a <c>Stream</c>
               metaphor.

               <c>ZipOutputStream</c> to produce a valid zip file, you use use it within
               a using clause (<c>Using</c> in VB), or call the <c>Dispose()</c> method

               Also, a note regarding compression performance: On the desktop .NET
               Framework, DotNetZip can use a multi-threaded compression implementation
               that provides significant speed increases on large files, over 300k or so,
               at the cost of increased memory use at runtime.  (The output of the
               compression is almost exactly the same size).  But, the multi-threaded
               approach incurs a performance hit on smaller files. There's no way for the
               ZipOutputStream to know whether parallel compression will be beneficial,
               because the ZipOutputStream does not know how much data you will write
               through the stream.  You may wish to set the <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipOutputStream.ParallelDeflateThreshold"/> property to zero, if you are compressing
               large files through <c>ZipOutputStream</c>.  This will cause parallel
               compression to be used, always.

               Using a password does not encrypt or protect the "directory" of the
               archive - the list of entries contained in the archive.  If you set the
               <c>Password</c> property, the password actually applies to individual
               entries that are added to the archive, subsequent to the setting of this
               property.  The list of filenames in the archive that is eventually created
               will appear in clear text, but the contents of the individual files are
               encrypted.  This is how Zip encryption works.

             <para>
               If you set this property, and then add a set of entries to the archive via

               password.  You may also want to change the password between adding
               different entries. If you set the password, add an entry, then set the
               password to <c>null</c> (<c>Nothing</c> in VB), and add another entry, the
               first entry is encrypted and the second is not.

               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipOutputStream.Encryption"/> property, to specify how to encrypt the entries added
               to the ZipFile.  If you set the <c>Password</c> to a non-null value and do not
               set <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipOutputStream.Encryption"/>, then PKZip 2.0 ("Weak") encryption is used.
               This encryption is relatively weak but is very interoperable. If
               you set the password to a <c>null</c> value (<c>Nothing</c> in VB),
               <c>Encryption</c> is reset to None.

             <para>
               The specification does not describe how to indicate the encoding used
               on a comment string. Many "compliant" zip tools and libraries use
               IBM437 as the code page for comments; DotNetZip, too, follows that
               practice.  On the other hand, there are situations where you want a
               Comment to be encoded with something else, for example using code page
               950 "Big-5 Chinese". To fill that need, DotNetZip will encode the
               comment following the same procedure it follows for encoding
               filenames: (a) if <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipOutputStream.AlternateEncodingUsage"/> is
               <c>Never</c>, it uses the default encoding (IBM437). (b) if <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipOutputStream.AlternateEncodingUsage"/> is <c>Always</c>, it always uses the
               alternate encoding (<see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipOutputStream.AlternateEncoding"/>). (c) if <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipOutputStream.AlternateEncodingUsage"/> is <c>AsNecessary</c>, it uses the
               alternate encoding only if the default encoding is not sufficient for
               encoding the comment - in other words if decoding the result does not
               produce the original string.  This decision is taken at the time of
               the call to <c>ZipFile.Save()</c>.

               comments in either the IBM437 code page, or in UTF-8.  This flag selects
               the encoding according to that specification.  By default, this flag is
               false, and filenames and comments are encoded into the zip file in the
               IBM437 codepage.  Setting this flag to true will specify that filenames

               Zip files created with strict adherence to the PKWare specification with

               any combination of Unicode characters, including the full range of
               characters from Chinese, Latin, Hebrew, Greek, Cyrillic, and many other
               alphabets.  However, because at this time, the UTF-8 portion of the PKWare
               specification is not broadly supported by other zip libraries and
               utilities, such zip files may not be readable by your favorite zip tool or
               archiver. In other words, interoperability will decrease if you set this

               In particular, Zip files created with strict adherence to the PKWare
               specification with respect to UTF-8 encoding will not work well with
               Explorer in Windows XP or Windows Vista, because Windows compressed
               folders, as far as I know, do not support UTF-8 in zip files.  Vista can
               read the zip files, but shows the filenames incorrectly. Unpacking from
               Windows Vista Explorer will result in filenames that have rubbish
               characters in place of the high-order UTF-8 bytes.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Also, zip files that use UTF-8 encoding will not work well with Java
               applications that use the java.util.zip classes, as of v5.0 of the Java
               runtime. The Java runtime does not correctly implement the PKWare
               specification in this regard.

             <para>
               As a result, we have the unfortunate situation that "correct" behavior by
               the DotNetZip library with regard to Unicode encoding of filenames during
               zip creation will result in zip files that are readable by strictly
               compliant and current tools (for example the most recent release of the
               commercial WinZip tool); but these zip files will not be readable by
               various other tools or libraries, including Windows Explorer.

             <para>
               The DotNetZip library can read and write zip files with UTF8-encoded
               entries, according to the PKware spec.  If you use DotNetZip for both
               creating and reading the zip file, and you use UTF-8, there will be no
               loss of information in the filenames. For example, using a self-extractor
               created by this library will allow you to unpack files correctly with no
               loss of information in the filenames.

             <para>
               If you do not set this flag, it will remain false.  If this flag is false,
               the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> will encode all filenames and comments using
               the IBM437 codepage.  This can cause "loss of information" on some
               filenames, but the resulting zipfile will be more interoperable with other
               utilities. As an example of the loss of information, diacritics can be
               lost.  The o-tilde character will be down-coded to plain o.  The c with a
               cedilla (Unicode 0xE7) used in Portugese will be downcoded to a c.
               Likewise, the O-stroke character (Unicode 248), used in Danish and
               Norwegian, will be down-coded to plain o. Chinese characters cannot be
               represented in codepage IBM437; when using the default encoding, Chinese
               characters in filenames will be represented as ?. These are all examples
               of "information loss".
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The loss of information associated to the use of the IBM437 encoding is
               inconvenient, and can also lead to runtime errors. For example, using
               IBM437, any sequence of 4 Chinese characters will be encoded as ????.  If
               your application creates a <c>ZipOutputStream</c>, does not set the
               encoding, then adds two files, each with names of four Chinese characters
               each, this will result in a duplicate filename exception.  In the case
               where you add a single file with a name containing four Chinese
               characters, the zipfile will save properly, but extracting that file
               later, with any zip tool, will result in an error, because the question
               mark is not legal for use within filenames on Windows.  These are just a
               few examples of the problems associated to loss of information.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               This flag is independent of the encoding of the content within the entries
               in the zip file. Think of the zip file as a container - it supports an
               encoding.  Within the container are other "containers" - the file entries
               themselves.  The encoding within those entries is independent of the
               encoding of the zip archive container for those entries.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               Rather than specify the encoding in a binary fashion using this flag, an
               application can specify an arbitrary encoding via the <see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipOutputStream.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding"/> property.  Setting the encoding
               explicitly when creating zip archives will result in non-compliant zip
               files that, curiously, are fairly interoperable.  The challenge is, the
               PKWare specification does not provide for a way to specify that an entry
               in a zip archive uses a code page that is neither IBM437 nor UTF-8.
               Therefore if you set the encoding explicitly when creating a zip archive,
               you must take care upon reading the zip archive to use the same code page.
               If you get it wrong, the behavior is undefined and may result in incorrect
               filenames, exceptions, stomach upset, hair loss, and acne.

               or libraries do not follow the specification, and instead encode

               Be aware that a zip file created after you've explicitly set the
               <c>ProvisionalAlternateEncoding</c> property to a value other than
               IBM437 may not be compliant to the PKWare specification, and may not be
               readable by compliant archivers.  On the other hand, many (most?)
               archivers are non-compliant and can read zip files created in arbitrary
               code pages.  The trick is to use or specify the proper codepage when
               reading the zip.

               When creating a zip archive using this library, it is possible to change
               the value of <c>ProvisionalAlternateEncoding</c> between each entry you
               add, and between adding entries and the call to <c>Close()</c>. Don't do
               this. It will likely result in a zipfile that is not readable.  For best
               interoperability, either leave <c>ProvisionalAlternateEncoding</c>
               alone, or specify it only once, before adding any entries to the
               <c>ZipOutputStream</c> instance.  There is one exception to this
               recommendation, described later.

               When using an arbitrary, non-UTF8 code page for encoding, there is no
               standard way for the creator application - whether DotNetZip, WinZip,
               WinRar, or something else - to formally specify in the zip file which
               codepage has been used for the entries. As a result, readers of zip files
               are not able to inspect the zip file and determine the codepage that was
               used for the entries contained within it.  It is left to the application
               or user to determine the necessary codepage when reading zip files encoded
               this way.  If you use an incorrect codepage when reading a zipfile, you
               will get entries with filenames that are incorrect, and the incorrect
               filenames may even contain characters that are not legal for use within
               filenames in Windows. Extracting entries with illegal characters in the
               filenames will lead to exceptions. It's too bad, but this is just the way
               things are with code pages in zip files. Caveat Emptor.

             <para>
               One possible approach for specifying the code page for a given zip file is
               to describe the code page in a human-readable form in the Zip comment. For
               example, the comment may read "Entries in this archive are encoded in the
               Big5 code page".  For maximum interoperability, the zip comment in this
               case should be encoded in the default, IBM437 code page.  In this case,
               the zip comment is encoded using a different page than the filenames.  To
               do this, Specify <c>ProvisionalAlternateEncoding</c> to your desired
               region-specific code page, once before adding any entries, and then set
               the <see cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipOutputStream.Comment"/> property and reset
               <c>ProvisionalAlternateEncoding</c> to IBM437 before calling <c>Close()</c>.

                 A parallel deflate operations will speed up the compression of
                 large files, on computers with multiple CPUs or multiple CPU
                 cores.  For files above 1mb, on a dual core or dual-cpu (2p)
                 machine, the time required to compress the file can be 70% of the
                 single-threaded deflate.  For very large files on 4p machines the
                 compression can be done in 30% of the normal time.  The downside
                 is that parallel deflate consumes extra memory during the deflate,
                 and the deflation is slightly less effective.

               <para>
                 Parallel deflate tends to not be as effective as single-threaded deflate
                 because the original data stream is split into multiple independent
                 buffers, each of which is compressed in parallel.  But because they are
                 treated independently, there is no opportunity to share compression
                 dictionaries, and additional framing bytes must be added to the output
                 stream.  For that reason, a deflated stream may be slightly larger when
                 compressed using parallel deflate, as compared to a traditional
                 single-threaded deflate. For files of about 512k, the increase over the
                 normal deflate is as much as 5% of the total compressed size. For larger
                 files, the difference can be as small as 0.1%.

                 Multi-threaded compression does not give as much an advantage when using
                 Encryption. This is primarily because encryption tends to slow down
                 the entire pipeline. Also, multi-threaded compression gives less of an
                 advantage when using lower compression levels, for example <see

               This property sets an upper limit on the number of memory
               buffer pairs to create when performing parallel
               compression.  The implementation of the parallel
               compression stream allocates multiple buffers to
               facilitate parallel compression.  As each buffer fills up,
               the stream uses <see
               cref="M:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(System.Threading.WaitCallback)">
               ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem()</see> to compress those
               buffers in a background threadpool thread. After a buffer
               is compressed, it is re-ordered and written to the output
               stream.

             <para>
               A higher number of buffer pairs enables a higher degree of
               parallelism, which tends to increase the speed of compression on
               multi-cpu computers.  On the other hand, a higher number of buffer
               pairs also implies a larger memory consumption, more active worker
               threads, and a higher cpu utilization for any compression. This
               property enables the application to limit its memory consumption and
               CPU utilization behavior depending on requirements.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               For each compression "task" that occurs in parallel, there are 2
               buffers allocated: one for input and one for output.  This property
               sets a limit for the number of pairs.  The total amount of storage
               space allocated for buffering will then be (N*S*2), where N is the
               number of buffer pairs, S is the size of each buffer (<see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.ZipOutputStream.CodecBufferSize"/>).  By default, DotNetZip allocates 4 buffer
               pairs per CPU core, so if your machine has 4 cores, and you retain
               the default buffer size of 128k, then the
               ParallelDeflateOutputStream will use 4 * 4 * 2 * 128kb of buffer
               memory in total, or 4mb, in blocks of 128kb.  If you then set this
               property to 8, then the number will be 8 * 2 * 128kb of buffer
               memory, or 2mb.

             <para>
               CPU utilization will also go up with additional buffers, because a
               larger number of buffer pairs allows a larger number of background
               threads to compress in parallel. If you find that parallel
               compression is consuming too much memory or CPU, you can adjust this
               value downward.
             </para>

               The default value is 16. Different values may deliver better or

               This property is not the number of buffer pairs to use; it is an
               upper limit. An illustration: Suppose you have an application that
               uses the default value of this property (which is 16), and it runs
               on a machine with 2 CPU cores. In that case, DotNetZip will allocate
               4 buffer pairs per CPU core, for a total of 8 pairs.  The upper
               limit specified by this property has no effect.

               IETF RFC 1952-compliant stream.  The data will be decompressed as you call

               property before calling <c>Write()</c> for the first time on the

               This constructor allows the application to request that the captive stream
               remain open after the deflation or inflation occurs.  By default, after
               <c>Close()</c> is called on the stream, the captive stream is also
               closed. In some cases this is not desired, for example if the stream is a
               memory stream that will be re-read after compressed data has been written
               to it.  Specify true for the <paramref name="leaveOpen"/> parameter to
               leave the stream open.

               As noted in the class documentation, the <c>CompressionMode</c> (Compress

               <c>GZipStream</c> with <c>CompressionMode.Compress</c> works only through

               approach that employs multiple worker threads to perform the DEFLATE.  On
               a multi-cpu or multi-core computer, the performance of this class can be
               significantly higher than the single-threaded DeflateStream, particularly
               for larger streams.  How large?  Anything over 10mb is a good candidate
               for parallel compression.

               The tradeoff is that this class uses more memory and more CPU than the
               vanilla DeflateStream, and also is less efficient as a compressor. For
               large files the size of the compressed data stream can be less than 1%
               larger than the size of a compressed data stream from the vanialla
               DeflateStream.  For smaller files the difference can be larger.  The
               difference will also be larger if you set the BufferSize to be lower than
               the default value.  Your mileage may vary. Finally, for small files, the
               ParallelDeflateOutputStream can be much slower than the vanilla
               DeflateStream, because of the overhead associated to using the thread
               pool.

               This property sets an upper limit on the number of memory buffer
               pairs to create.  The implementation of this stream allocates
               multiple buffers to facilitate parallel compression.  As each buffer
               fills up, this stream uses <see
               cref="M:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(System.Threading.WaitCallback)">
               ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem()</see>
               to compress those buffers in a background threadpool thread. After a
               buffer is compressed, it is re-ordered and written to the output
               stream.

               A higher number of buffer pairs enables a higher degree of
               parallelism, which tends to increase the speed of compression on
               multi-cpu computers.  On the other hand, a higher number of buffer
               pairs also implies a larger memory consumption, more active worker
               threads, and a higher cpu utilization for any compression. This
               property enables the application to limit its memory consumption and
               CPU utilization behavior depending on requirements.

             <para>
               For each compression "task" that occurs in parallel, there are 2
               buffers allocated: one for input and one for output.  This property
               sets a limit for the number of pairs.  The total amount of storage
               space allocated for buffering will then be (N*S*2), where N is the
               number of buffer pairs, S is the size of each buffer (<see
               cref="P:ScrapperMinDLL.Zlib.ParallelDeflateOutputStream.BufferSize"/>).  By default, DotNetZip allocates 4 buffer
               pairs per CPU core, so if your machine has 4 cores, and you retain
               the default buffer size of 128k, then the
               ParallelDeflateOutputStream will use 4 * 4 * 2 * 128kb of buffer
               memory in total, or 4mb, in blocks of 128kb.  If you then set this
               property to 8, then the number will be 8 * 2 * 128kb of buffer
               memory, or 2mb.

             <para>
               CPU utilization will also go up with additional buffers, because a
               larger number of buffer pairs allows a larger number of background
               threads to compress in parallel. If you find that parallel
               compression is consuming too much memory or CPU, you can adjust this
               value downward.
             </para>
            
             <para>
               The default value is 16. Different values may deliver better or
               worse results, depending on your priorities and the dynamic
               performance characteristics of your storage and compute resources.

               This property is not the number of buffer pairs to use; it is an
               upper limit. An illustration: Suppose you have an application that
               uses the default value of this property (which is 16), and it runs
               on a machine with 2 CPU cores. In that case, DotNetZip will allocate
               4 buffer pairs per CPU core, for a total of 8 pairs.  The upper
               limit specified by this property has no effect.

               The application can set this value at any time, but it is effective

               Larger buffer sizes implies larger memory consumption but allows
               more efficient compression. Using smaller buffer sizes consumes less
               memory but may result in less effective compression.  For example,
               using the default buffer size of 128k, the compression delivered is
               within 1% of the compression delivered by the single-threaded <see
               cref="!:ScrapperMinDLL..DeflateStream"/>.  On the other hand, using a
               BufferSize of 8k can result in a compressed data stream that is 5%
               larger than that delivered by the single-threaded
               <c>DeflateStream</c>.  Excessively small buffer sizes can also cause
               the speed of the ParallelDeflateOutputStream to drop, because of
               larger thread scheduling overhead dealing with many many small
               buffers.

               The total amount of storage space allocated for buffering will be
               (N*S*2), where N is the number of buffer pairs, and S is the size of
               each buffer (this property). There are 2 buffers used by the
               compressor, one for input and one for output.  By default, DotNetZip
               allocates 4 buffer pairs per CPU core, so if your machine has 4
               cores, then the number of buffer pairs used will be 16. If you
               accept the default value of this property, 128k, then the
               ParallelDeflateOutputStream will use 16 * 2 * 128kb of buffer memory
               in total, or 4mb, in blocks of 128kb.  If you set this property to
               64kb, then the number will be 16 * 2 * 64kb of buffer memory, or
               2mb.

               Because the ParallelDeflateOutputStream is expensive to create, it
               has been designed so that it can be recycled and re-used.  You have
               to call Close() on the stream first, then you can call Reset() on
               it, to use it again on another stream.

            This gauges the size of the sliding window, and hence the 
            compression effectiveness as well as memory consumption. It's best to just leave this 
            setting alone if you don't know what it is.  The maximum value is 15 bits, which implies
            a 32k window.

            <remarks>
            This is only effective in compression.  The theory offered by ZLIB is that different
            strategies could potentially produce significant differences in compression behavior
            for different data sets.  Unfortunately I don't have any good recommendations for how
            to set it differently.  When I tested changing the strategy I got minimally different
            compression performance. It's best to leave this property alone if you don't have a
            good feel for it.  Or, you may want to produce a test harness that runs through the
            different strategy options and evaluates them on different file types. If you do that,
            let me know your results.
